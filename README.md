# UC Davis Water Management Lab: Dimensionless Hydrograph Calculator

This repository contains tools for plotting dimensionless hydrographs given a flow timeseries. The two directories contain the tools for calculating hydrographs from 1) a single timeseries, and 2) a set of timeseries, in which the flow values are averaged among all timeseries to generate a single final plot. The tools are designed to accept csv file data, and more detailed data requirement information is available in the readme's for each tool.    

For questions about the dimensionless hydrograph tools, contact Noelle Patterson at nkpatterson@ucdavis.edu.
