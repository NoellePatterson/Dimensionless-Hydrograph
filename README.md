# ucd-eflow : UC Davis Environmental Flows Project

This repository is for happily sharing code between the people involved in the project with coding tasks. This repository is **private**, meaning that the scripts updloaded there are not available to the general public. This might change in the future, upon completion of the project or if some people want to share code with research communities. Similarly, even if the repository is under my username, if you want to you can add your own public repository to highlight your work and coding skills.
